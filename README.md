-- 🎯 Customer Behavior Analysis
```
```sql
SELECT 
    am.NAME AS customer_name,
    COUNT(tm.TRANSACTION_NUMBER) as transaction_count,
    SUM(tm.TXN_AMOUNT) as total_volume,
    AVG(tm.TXN_AMOUNT) as avg_transaction,
    MAX(tm.DATE_OF_TRANSACTION) as last_transaction
FROM [ACCOUNT MASTER] am
LEFT JOIN [TRANSACTION MASTER] tm ON am.ACID = tm.ACID
GROUP BY am.ACID, am.NAME
ORDER BY total_volume DESC;
```
-- 📊 Branch Performance Dashboard
```sql
SELECT 
    bm.[BRANCH NAME],
    COUNT(DISTINCT am.ACID) as total_accounts,
    COUNT(tm.TRANSACTION_NUMBER) as total_transactions,

WITH high_value_customers AS (
    SELECT 
        am.NAME,
        am.[CLEAR BALANCE],
        COUNT(tm.TRANSACTION_NUMBER) as txn_frequency,
        DATEDIFF(day, MAX(tm.[DATE OF TRANSACTION]), GETDATE()) as days_inactive
    FROM [ACCOUNT MASTER] am
    LEFT JOIN [TRANSACTION MASTER] tm ON am.ACID = tm.ACID
    WHERE am.[CLEAR BALANCE] > 50000
